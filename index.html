        <h2 class="header">Information on Red Fox Labs</h2>
        <div class="information"><p>Red Fox Labs are <em>variants</em> of the Labrador Retriever breed. They are a kind of gun dog. Gun dogs are dogs
            that are used to help hunters find and retrieve whatever they are hunting, usually birds. Labradors Retrievers
            are the most popular dog breed in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
            They are strong swimers because of the webbing inbetween the toes on their paws. Labradors love to be active
            and love playing in the water no matter the temperature because their coats protect them. They typically come
            in black, brown, and yellow. Red Fox Labs aren't very common.</p></div>
